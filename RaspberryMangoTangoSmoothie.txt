Ingredients:

1/2 of a large banana, previously peeled, sliced, and frozen1
1/2 cup Bai5 Malawi Mango
1 cup frozen mango (fresh is OK, but frozen is preferred to get a thick texture smoothie)
1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries
Directions:

Make sure you have a strong, powerful blender that will blend up the frozen banana and mango. I like this Ninja, this Ninja, and this Vitamix.
Add all of the ingredients2 to the blender in the order listed. Blend on high for at least 3 minutes or until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the blender as needed. Add more Bai5 if it's too thick.
Serve and enjoy. Store any leftover smoothie covered in the refrigerator for up to 8-10 hours.
